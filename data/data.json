Organic Paprika always starts with peppers, the sweeter, gentler cousin of the hot chili pepper family. Paprika is a mellow ingredient, bringing slightly sweet and toasty notes to chicken paprikash, pork or beef stew, casseroles, roasted potatoes or vegetables, barbecue sauce and marinades. Use paprika as a base for your own spice rubs for barbecued meats or simply sprinkle on roast chicken or pork. Paprika's bright red colour makes it a pleasing garnish for egg and fish dishes, potato salad, and mac and cheese.",

The drying process mellows the raw garlic flavour and adds a subtle sweet flavour. The result is a savoury, salty seasoning that?  s perfect for meat, chicken or seafood. It also makes a great base for dry rubs for barbecued ribs or steaks. Add garlic salt to enhance flavour in dips, potatoes, vegetables, pastas and more. Use as an all-purpose seasoning anywhere you?  d use regular salt and want to punch up the flavor.",

It was grown at an elevation between 1,550 and 2,200 metres?  at higher elevations, it takes longer for coffee cherry fruit to mature, resulting in a coffee with more complex sugars and deeper, more nuanced flavours. This coffee is blended from both washed and unwashed beans. Washed beans are cleaned of most of their fruit pulp, while unwashed beans have more fruit left on them, which can produce coffee with intricate, nuanced fruit notes with acidity. A blend of both means you get a cup featuring bright acidity and fruity notes like blueberry. Medium roasted to perfection in Canada, it comes packed in our award-winning, recyclable packaging**.<br><br>Brew tip: This grind size is best for flat-bottomed filter coffee and pour-overs.<br><br><i>*The Rainforest Alliance supports sustainable coffee farming practices.
